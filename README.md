# 🐦 Twitter Data Analysis using Python

## 📘 Introduction

This project explores the potential of Twitter data for social research by analyzing a collection of tweets using Python. By examining tweet content, engagement metrics, and sentiment, the analysis uncovers trends, user behavior, and topics of public interest.

---

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- Uncover hidden patterns within tweet data.
- Analyze user sentiment on various topics.
- Measure engagement (likes, retweets) to identify influential content.
- Explore trending themes and popular discussions using text analysis.

---

## 📊 Data Source

The dataset consists of publicly available tweets retrieved via:
- **Twitter API**, or
- **Third-party datasets** from reputable sources.

### ✅ Justification for Twitter Data
- **Real-Time**: Captures live public sentiment and opinions.
- **High Volume**: Provides statistically significant patterns.
- **Diverse Demographics**: Broad user base allows cross-sectional analysis.

## 🧠 Types of Analysis

### 📈 Engagement Analysis
- Average likes and retweets
- Identify tweets that generate high interaction

### 😊 Sentiment Analysis
- Use TextBlob to classify tweets as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**
- Understand public opinion toward specific topics

### 📝 Text Content Analysis
- Word frequency and distribution
- N-grams (bigrams, trigrams)
- (Optional) Topic Modeling using LDA or similar methods

### ⏱️ Optional Analyses
- **Network Analysis**: Understand retweet/reply networks and influence
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze how sentiments and topics change over time

## 🔧 Implementation Overview

### 🔄 Data Loading & Cleaning
- Load tweets from `.csv` or `.json` files
- Clean text (remove URLs, mentions, punctuation, etc.)
- Drop irrelevant columns and handle missing data

### 🧹 Text Preprocessing
- Convert text to lowercase
- Tokenize
- Remove stop words
- Stemming or lemmatization

### 📊 Engagement Metrics
- Calculate averages and visualize retweets/likes distribution

### 😊 Sentiment Classification
- Use TextBlob to label sentiment
- Visualize distribution with pie charts or histograms

### 📚 Textual Insights
- Word frequency (bar charts or word clouds)
- N-gram frequency analysis
- Explore emerging themes or commonly used phrases

---

## 📊 Visualization Examples

- **Bar Charts**: Likes/retweets across sentiment categories
- **Word Clouds**: Frequent terms
- **Pie Charts**: Sentiment distribution
- **Scatter Plots**: Sentiment vs. engagement
